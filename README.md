This project demonstrates how to create a responsive city skyline using HTML and CSS. The project includes a dynamic feature where the city skyline changes from day mode to night mode based on the screen size.

Responsive Design:
The city skyline adjusts its layout and appearance based on the screen size.
Utilizes CSS flexbox and media queries to create a flexible and adaptable design.

Day/Night Mode:
When the screen size is maximized (e.g., desktop view), the city skyline is displayed in day mode with a light blue sky.
When the screen size is reduced (e.g., mobile view), the city skyline switches to night mode with a dark blue sky and buildings that change colors to represent a nighttime scene.
